# Snake Game

This is a classic Snake game developed using Pygame. It is designed as a practice exercise to improve and apply Python programming skills.

## Overview

The Snake game involves controlling a snake that moves around the screen, eating food to grow longer. The goal is to achieve the highest score possible while avoiding collisions with the walls and the snakeâ€™s own body.


### This code is based on the tutorial from this [YouTube video](https://youtu.be/1zVlRXd8f7g?si=pmqDk_DFtBRqgej2).

## How It Works

- **Game Loop**: Handles user input, updates the game state, and renders graphics.
- **Snake Movement**: Moves in the direction of the arrow keys and grows when eating food.
- **Collision Detection**: Ends the game if the snake collides with the walls or itself.
- **Food Mechanics**: Food appears randomly, and eating it increases the snake's length and score.

## Purpose

This project is created to practice and enhance Python programming skills through hands-on experience. It includes:

- Implementing core game mechanics.
- Handling real-time user input.
- Detecting and managing collisions.
- Practicing general Python coding skills.
